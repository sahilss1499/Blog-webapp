# Blog-webapp
Django based web app for writing and posting blogs.
It has backend part written in python using Django framework, the frontend is made and designed using HTML and CSS with some bootstrap on top of it. 
It has got various features like viewing blogs, comments etc. When you are not logged in. 
Once you login (must be a superuser) you can write blogs by clicking on New Post button in the navbar, you get several text editing options to use! 
This is done by using external CDN of Medium Style Editor [(Link to its github)](https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/). 
If you are stuck up and not getting ideas then you can easily save your blog as a draft. 
You can later edit your draft and then post it for others to see. Now, once a blog is posted people can comment on any blog (after login as a superuser). 
After writing a comment you will be asked to verify the comment before posting. A comment can be deleted if it is inappropriate.
